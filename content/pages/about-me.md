I am an American author of Horror and Fantasy. When I’m not busy reading and writing, I value spending quality time with my wife and four children, playing and writing music, birdwatching, and way too many other hobbies.

I’ve written several short stories (which you can find here, for free!) and two novels, which are currently being edited and prepared for publication.
