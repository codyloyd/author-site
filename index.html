  <p>
  I am an American author of Horror and Fantasy. When I’m not busy reading and writing, I value spending quality time with my wife and four children, playing and writing music, birdwatching, and way too many other hobbies.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’ve written several short stories (which you can find here, for free!) and two novels, which are currently being edited and prepared for publication.
